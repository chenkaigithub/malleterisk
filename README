MSc Thesis code (Learning methods for Automatic Email Message Tagging). 
Under Development.

A library (can be seen as an extension of) built with Mallet (http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/).
It still has alot of garbage, tangled code and many things to be implemented.

Currently: contains some feature weighting and feature selection methods, class balancing methods (basic) and some more miscellanous stuff
Planned: keyword extraction methods, peoplefier, wrappers for some classifiers, etc yada yada
